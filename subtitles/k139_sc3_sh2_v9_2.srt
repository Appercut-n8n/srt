00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:12,430
One of the two key pelvic floor muscles that's crucial for men's sexual health is called the ischiocavernosis muscle.

3
00:00:15,594 --> 00:00:22,875
It helps to fill and properly maintain blood in the male organ, which is necessary so that a man can achieve and maintain an erection.

4
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:31,740
And did you know that men can strengthen this muscle with Kegel exercises and significantly improve their erection?

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:42,951
Numerous studies have found that with Kegel exercises, more than 70% of men achieve firmer, longer erections and can eliminate ED.

00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:56,611
these exercises are very easy to do and only take five minutes a day.

00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:02,268
You can do them standing, sitting, or even lying on the couch watching TV.

00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:07,881
But the best way to do Kegel is with an app, as it's much more comfortable and efficient.

00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,844
I recommend trying the Dr. A

00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,170
Kegel app.

00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:17,396
It provides

00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:27,787
