1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,512
Real talk,

2
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:00,974
guys —

3
00:00:00,974 --> 00:00:01,437
I could

4
00:00:01,437 --> 00:00:01,899
deadlift 400

5
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:02,361
pounds, but

6
00:00:02,361 --> 00:00:02,823
in bed

7
00:00:02,823 --> 00:00:03,286
I was

8
00:00:03,286 --> 00:00:03,748
a one-minute

9
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:04,210
man.

10
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:04,822
Jacked in

11
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:05,334
the mirror,

12
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:05,846
floppy rookie

13
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:06,358
in the

14
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:06,870
sheets.

15
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,434
I’m not

16
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:07,898
gonna lie,

17
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:08,362
that thing

18
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:08,826
shattered my

19
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:09,290
ego.

20
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,968
You pretend

21
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:10,546
you’re this

22
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:11,123
confident dude,

23
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:11,701
but in

24
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,279
your head

25
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:12,857
you’re just

26
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:13,434
praying it

27
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:14,012
doesn’t end

28
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:14,590
in embarrassment.

29
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,340
I tried

30
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,990
all that

31
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,640
usual BS

32
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,290
— supplements,

33
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:17,940
NoFap, cold

34
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,590
showers, and

35
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,240
all that

36
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,890
YouTube nonsense.

37
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,572
No results,

38
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:21,154
because I

39
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:21,735
was neglecting

40
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:22,317
the muscles

41
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:22,899
that actually

42
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:23,481
run blood

43
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,063
flow and

44
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:24,645
control down

45
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:25,226
there —

46
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:25,808
the pelvic

47
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:26,390
floor muscles.

48
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,143
And when

49
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:27,797
I started

50
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:28,450
to train

51
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,103
them with

52
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:29,757
Kegel exercises,

53
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:30,410
everything changed.

54
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:30,985
Day one,

55
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:31,459
I just

56
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:31,934
found that

57
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:32,409
switch —

58
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:32,883
squeeze, release

59
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:33,358
— and

60
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:33,833
for the

61
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,307
first time

62
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:34,782
I could

63
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:35,257
feel these

64
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:35,731
muscles and

65
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,206
blood actually

66
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:36,681
moving into

67
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:37,155
the groin

68
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:37,630
area.

69
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,205
Week two,

70
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:38,681
I could

71
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:39,156
feel that

72
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:39,631
edge before

73
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:40,106
finishing, and

74
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:40,582
for the

75
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,057
first time

76
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:41,532
in my

77
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:42,008
life I

78
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:42,483
had brakes

79
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:42,958
— not

80
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:43,434
just hope,

81
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:43,909
I could

82
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:44,384
actually suppress

83
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:44,859
that urge

84
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:45,335
and last

85
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:45,810
longer.

86
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,420
And by

87
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:46,930
week four,

88
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,440
here was

89
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:47,950
the biggest

90
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,460
shift: my

91
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:48,970
erections felt

92
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,480
so solid

93
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:49,990
I thought

94
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,500
I was

95
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,010
back in

96
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,520
my twenties,

97
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,030
and the

98
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,540
control became

99
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,050
so great

100
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,560
that I

101
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,070
was able

102
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,580
to last

103
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,090
literally as

104
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,600
long as

105
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,110
I wanted

106
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,620
and finish

107
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,130
exactly when

108
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,640
I wanted

109
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,150
to.

110
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:58,753
Now I

111
00:00:58,753 --> 00:00:59,256
could choose

112
00:00:59,256 --> 00:00:59,759
the pace

113
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,261
instead of

114
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:00,764
my nerves

115
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:01,267
choosing for

116
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:01,770
me.

117
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,510
Once my

118
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,150
body started

119
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,790
listening, that

120
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,430
anxiety dropped

121
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,070
and I

122
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,710
finally became

123
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,350
confident.

124
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,170
I didn’t

125
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:07,890
freestyle this.

126
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,484
I used

127
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:08,978
an app

128
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:09,472
called Dr.

129
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:09,966
Kegel —

130
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:10,461
it guided

131
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:10,955
me step

132
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:11,449
by step

133
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:11,943
on how

134
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:12,437
to do

135
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:12,931
Kegels correctly,

136
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:13,425
fully private,

137
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:13,919
at my

138
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:14,414
home, and

139
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:14,908
it took

140
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,402
just five

141
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:15,896
minutes a

142
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:16,390
day.

143
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:16,959
If any

144
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,427
of this

145
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:17,896
sounds like

146
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:18,364
you, stop

147
00:01:18,364 --> 00:01:18,833
pretending it’ll

148
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,301
fix itself

149
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:19,770
— just

150
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,239
try Dr.

151
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:20,707
Kegel for

152
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:21,176
a few

153
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:21,644
weeks and

154
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:22,113
see what

155
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:22,581
your body

156
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:23,050
does.
