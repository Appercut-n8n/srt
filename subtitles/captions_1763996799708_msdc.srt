1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,517
This is

2
00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:00,983
probably the

3
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:01,450
most important

4
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:01,917
muscle in

5
00:00:01,917 --> 00:00:02,383
a man's

6
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:02,850
body.

7
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,626
Every man

8
00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:04,301
has a

9
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:04,977
special muscle

10
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:05,652
responsible for

11
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:06,328
erectile function

12
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:07,003
located at

13
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:07,679
the base

14
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,354
of the

15
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:09,030
male organ.

16
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,210
It's called

17
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,290
the Ischiocavernosus.

18
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,015
What's interesting

19
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:12,641
is that

20
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:13,266
by doing

21
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:13,892
Kegel exercises,

22
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:14,517
men can

23
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:15,143
strengthen this

24
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:15,768
muscle and

25
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:16,394
increase blood

26
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:17,019
flow to

27
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:17,645
the groin

28
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:18,270
area.

29
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,113
This makes

30
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:19,856
erections more

31
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:20,599
firm, longer

32
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:21,341
lasting, and

33
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:22,084
can even

34
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:22,827
eliminate ED

35
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:23,570
completely.

36
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,570
Additionally, trials

37
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,470
show that

38
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,370
Kegels also

39
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,270
improve ejaculation.

40
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:27,930
For that

41
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,490
reason, Kegels

42
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,050
are regarded

43
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,610
as the

44
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,170
best way

45
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,730
to improve

46
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,290
men's health

47
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:31,850
naturally.

48
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,500
And for

49
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,050
the long

50
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:33,600
term, talking

51
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,150
from experience,

52
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,700
it's better

53
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,250
to do

54
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:35,800
them with

55
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,350
the app.

56
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,143
It's much

57
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:37,837
more comfortable

58
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:38,530
and efficient.

59
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,206
The one

60
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:39,782
that I'd

61
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:40,358
recommend is

62
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:40,934
called Dr.

63
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:41,510
Kegel.

64
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,202
It provides

65
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:42,794
you with

66
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:43,386
a step-by-step

67
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:43,978
plan on

68
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:44,570
how to

69
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,162
exercise correctly,

70
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:45,754
and it

71
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,346
takes just

72
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:46,938
five minutes

73
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:47,530
a day.

74
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,190
It's very

75
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:48,750
simple.

76
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,357
Just go

77
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:49,863
to the

78
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:50,370
Dr. Kegel

79
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,877
website, take

80
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:51,383
a short

81
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:51,890
quiz, and

82
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,397
you'll get

83
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:52,903
your personal

84
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:53,410
plan.
