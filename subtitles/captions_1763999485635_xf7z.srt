1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,733
The worst

2
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:01,415
mistake that

3
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:02,098
men can

4
00:00:02,098 --> 00:00:02,781
make when

5
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:03,463
trying to

6
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:04,146
improve their

7
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:04,829
sexual health

8
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:05,511
is using

9
00:00:05,511 --> 00:00:06,194
meds and

10
00:00:06,194 --> 00:00:06,877
testosterone boosters

11
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:07,559
first while

12
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,242
completely ignoring

13
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:08,925
a much

14
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:09,607
more effective

15
00:00:09,607 --> 00:00:10,290
alternative.

16
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,973
You see,

17
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:11,556
while meds

18
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:12,139
can provide

19
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:12,721
desirable effects,

20
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,304
they only

21
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:13,887
last for

22
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:14,470
a couple

23
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,053
of hours

24
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:15,636
because, let's

25
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:16,219
face it,

26
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:16,801
they're treating

27
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,384
the symptoms,

28
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:17,967
not the

29
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:18,550
real issue.

30
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,326
But the

31
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:20,003
worst part

32
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:20,679
is that

33
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,355
regular use

34
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,032
can lead

35
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:22,708
to serious

36
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:23,385
side effects

37
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:24,061
like heart

38
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:24,737
palpitations, muscle

39
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:25,414
aches, insomnia,

40
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:26,090
and more.

41
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,919
That's why

42
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:27,648
research suggests

43
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,377
a safer

44
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:29,106
and more

45
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:29,834
effective way

46
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:30,563
that men

47
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:31,292
should use

48
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:32,021
first, called

49
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:32,750
Kegel exercises.

50
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,367
And if

51
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:33,884
you think

52
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:34,401
that Kegels

53
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:34,919
are something

54
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:35,436
complicated that

55
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:35,953
takes a

56
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:36,470
lot of

57
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,987
time, you're

58
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:37,504
completely wrong

59
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,021
because they

60
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:38,539
can take

61
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,056
just five

62
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:39,573
minutes a

63
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,090
day.

64
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,693
These exercises

65
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:41,196
are so

66
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:41,699
simple, you

67
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:42,201
don't even

68
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:42,704
have to

69
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:43,207
lift a

70
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:43,710
finger.

71
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,290
You can

72
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:44,770
literally do

73
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,250
them while

74
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,730
lying on

75
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,210
the couch

76
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:46,690
watching your

77
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,170
favorite TV

78
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,650
show.

79
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,379
And while

80
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:49,009
some men

81
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:49,638
find out

82
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:50,268
about Kegels

83
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:50,897
on the

84
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:51,526
internet, they

85
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:52,156
usually have

86
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:52,785
no idea

87
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:53,415
how to

88
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:54,044
use the

89
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:54,674
pelvic floor

90
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:55,303
muscles, how

91
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:55,932
often to

92
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:56,562
exercise, or

93
00:00:56,562 --> 00:00:57,191
which exercises

94
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:57,821
are the

95
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:58,450
most effective.

96
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,163
Naturally, you

97
00:00:59,163 --> 00:00:59,777
start wondering,

98
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:00,390
okay, but

99
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,003
how can

100
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:01,617
I do

101
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:02,230
Kegels properly?

102
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,922
In my

103
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:03,514
opinion, the

104
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:04,106
best way

105
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:04,698
to do

106
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,290
them is

107
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,882
with an

108
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:06,474
app because

109
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:07,066
it can

110
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:07,658
provide you

111
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:08,250
with a

112
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,842
proper step-by-step

113
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:09,434
workout plan

114
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:10,026
with proven

115
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:10,618
and effective

116
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:11,210
exercises.

117
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:11,805
The biggest

118
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:12,299
and most

119
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:12,794
trustworthy one

120
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:13,288
is the

121
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:13,783
Dr. Kegel

122
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:14,277
app, and

123
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:14,772
this is

124
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:15,266
the app

125
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:15,761
that I

126
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:16,255
personally use

127
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:16,750
too.
