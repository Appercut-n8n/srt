1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,915
There are

2
00:00:00,915 --> 00:00:01,781
two special

3
00:00:01,781 --> 00:00:02,646
muscles that

4
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:03,512
play the

5
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:04,377
most significant

6
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:05,243
role in

7
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:06,108
male sexual

8
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:06,974
health and

9
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:07,839
performance: the

10
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,705
Ischiocavernosus and

11
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:09,570
the Bulbospongiosus.

12
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,319
The Ischiocavernosus

13
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:10,969
is located

14
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:11,618
at the

15
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:12,268
base of

16
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:12,917
the male

17
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:13,566
organ, and

18
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:14,216
this muscle

19
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:14,865
helps to

20
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:15,515
fill and

21
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,164
maintain blood

22
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:16,814
in the

23
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:17,463
organ so

24
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:18,112
that a

25
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:18,762
man can

26
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:19,411
achieve and

27
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,061
maintain an

28
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:20,710
erection.

29
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,567
The second

30
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,324
one, the

31
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:23,081
Bulbospongiosus, stretches

32
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:23,838
along the

33
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:24,595
root, and

34
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:25,352
this muscle

35
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:26,108
is responsible

36
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:26,865
for how

37
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:27,622
long you

38
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:28,379
can last

39
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,136
because it

40
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:29,893
controls the

41
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:30,650
ejaculatory reflex.

42
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,541
The key

43
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,331
point is

44
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:33,122
that by

45
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:33,912
doing kegel

46
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:34,703
exercises, men

47
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:35,494
can strengthen

48
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,284
these muscles

49
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,075
and significantly

50
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:37,865
improve their

51
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:38,656
erections and

52
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,446
endurance, which

53
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,237
is confirmed

54
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:41,028
by the

55
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:41,818
latest survey

56
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:42,609
where 88%

57
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,399
of men

58
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,190
reported improvements.

59
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:44,957
The effect

60
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:45,623
is natural

61
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:46,290
and long-lasting.

62
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:46,997
One of

63
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:47,605
the easiest

64
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:48,212
and most

65
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:48,819
comfortable ways

66
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:49,426
to do

67
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:50,034
Kegels is

68
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:50,641
with an

69
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,248
app called

70
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:51,855
Dr. Kegel,

71
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:52,463
which can

72
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:53,070
provide a

73
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,677
step-by-step on

74
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:54,285
how to

75
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:54,892
exercise correctly;

76
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:55,499
you can

77
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:56,106
exercise while

78
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:56,714
lying on

79
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:57,321
the couch,

80
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:57,928
and it

81
00:00:57,928 --> 00:00:58,535
takes just

82
00:00:58,535 --> 00:00:59,143
five minutes

83
00:00:59,143 --> 00:00:59,750
a day.
